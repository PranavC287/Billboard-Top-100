DatabaseTotalis.db is the database which we will use
Main.py Creates the whole database
query.py runs the queries and is interactive. 

Most txt files are data which the main.py reads from to create DatabaseTotalis.db

Tester.sql is all the code which was tested prior to implementing into query.py and Main.py
